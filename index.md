I am a research engineer at [SwiftKey](http://www.swiftkey.com). I specialise in applications of deep learning to natural language processing. I am especially interested in recurrent and convolutional neural networks applied to next word prediction and sentiment analysis. I like to develop my software in [Torch](http://www.torch.ch) and [DP](https://github.com/nicholas-leonard/dp).
I often dream of the [babel fish](http://hitchhikers.wikia.com/wiki/Babel_Fish).

###Education:

I started my university studies at the Universtiy of Bologna, in the Computer Science department. In March 2006 I got my bachelor degree in Computer Science with the mark
of 110 Cum Laude. During this time I have been also a member of the [Collegio Superiore](http://www.collegio.unibo.it/en) of the University of Bologna.

<br/>
For my master degree I moved to the Netherlands. I attended the master in [Parallel and Distributed Computer Systems](http://www.vu.nl/en/programmes/international-masters/programmes/n-q/parallel-and-distributed-computer-systems-msc/) at the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam.
I graduated in 2008. My master thesis was about decentralized job scheduling in large-scale Grids.

<br/>
Until 2012 I have been a PhD student at Imperial College London, in the [Large-scale Distributed Systems](http://lsds.doc.ic.ac.uk/) group, under the supervision of Peter Pietzuch.
I worked on DISSP: the Dependable Internet-Scale Stream Processing system. I investigated the dependability issues arising when building an internet-scale stream processing system, able to work under constant failure, and reporting the quality of service in real-time to the user.
