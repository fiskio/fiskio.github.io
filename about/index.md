###Education:

I started my university studies at the Universtiy of Bologna, in the Computer Science department. In March 2006 I got my bachelor degree in Computer Science with the mark
of 110 Cum Laude. During this time I have been also a member of the Collegio Superiore of the University of Bologna.

<br/>
For my master degree I moved to the Netherlands. I attended the master in Parallel and Distributed Computer Systems at the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam.
I graduated in 2008. My master thesis was about decentralized job scheduling in large-scale Grids.

<br/>
Until 2012 I have been a PhD student at Imperial College London, in the Large-scale Distributed Systems group, under the supervision of Peter Pietzuch.
I worked on DISSP: the Dependable Internet-Scale Stream Processing system. I investigated the dependability issues arising when building an internet-scale stream processing system, able to work under constant failure, and reporting the quality of service in real-time to the user.
